## Key Features

- **30+ Components** - Comprehensive library covering all common UI needs
- **Copy & Paste** - Components are added to your codebase, not installed as dependencies
- **TypeScript First** - Fully typed with excellent IDE support
- **Animated** - Smooth 60fps animations with React Native Reanimated
- **Customizable** - Modify components to match your design system
- **Production Ready** - Battle-tested and ready for production use

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';

export default function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <>
      <Input label="Email" placeholder="you@example.com" />
      <Input label="Password" secureTextEntry />
      <Button onPress={handleLogin}>Login</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```
